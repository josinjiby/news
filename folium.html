<h2>
College of Engineering Trivandrum is proud to present Team Folium Eco-drive, our student technical club representing CET at Shell Eco-marathon Qatar in 2025. They have built their first prototype EV for the marathon with support from Eram Power Electronics Company. We extend our gratitude to Eram Power Electronics Company for sponsoring Folium Eco-Drive CET. Their valuable patronage has helped our students to race on the international circuit and we hope for their continued support to Folium Eco-drive.
