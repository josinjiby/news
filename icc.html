The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is set to kick off on February 19, featuring some of the most anticipated cricket battles. The tournament will be held in Pakistan and the UAE, with the final scheduled for March 92.

Key matches to watch out for include the historic rivalry between India and Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai, and the Ashes clash between Australia and England on February 22 in Lahore. The tournament will see eight teams divided into two groups: Group A consists of Bangladesh, India, New Zealand, and Pakistan, while Group B includes Afghanistan, Australia, England, and South Africa2.

New Zealand's pace attack has suffered a blow with Lockie Ferguson being ruled out due to a foot injury. Meanwhile, the BCCI has addressed the controversy over the absence of the Indian flag at the National Stadium in Karachi, emphasizing that all participating nations' flags should be displayed4.

Stay tuned for more updates as the tournament progresses and teams vie for the coveted Champions Trophy.
