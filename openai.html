<h2>
In a dramatic turn of events, OpenAI's board of directors has unanimously rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion takeover bid2. The decision was announced on Friday, with Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's board, stating that the proposal was not in the best interests of OpenAI's mission2.

Musk, an early investor in OpenAI, has been embroiled in a legal battle with the company for nearly a year. He claims that OpenAI has strayed from its founding mission as a nonprofit research lab dedicated to benefiting the public good2. Musk's legal offensive began with a lawsuit for breach of contract, alleging that OpenAI had betrayed its original aims2.

The dispute escalated when Musk, along with his AI startup xAI and several investment firms, announced their intention to buy the nonprofit entity that controls OpenAI2. However, OpenAI's board has firmly rejected the bid, citing new material conditions introduced in Musk's recent court filing2.

As the legal battle continues, a federal judge has expressed skepticism about some of Musk's claims but has allowed the case to move forward to trial. The outcome of this high-stakes dispute could have significant implications for the future of AI research and development.
