			United States. The former president, who served from 2017 to 2021, secured a decisive victory in the latest
			election, marking a significant shift in the political landscape.
	
			Trump's campaign focused on promises to revitalize the economy, strengthen national security, and address key
			issues such as immigration and healthcare. His message resonated with a broad base of voters, leading to a
			sweeping win across several key battleground states.
	
			In his victory speech, Trump expressed gratitude to his supporters and outlined his vision for the future. "This
			is not just a victory for me, but for every American who believes in the promise of our great nation," he said.
